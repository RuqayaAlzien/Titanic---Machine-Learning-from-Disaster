## Introduction
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this challenge, we are tasked with predicting which passengers survived the tragedy. This project utilizes various machine learning models to make these predictions.

## Data
The dataset provided by Kaggle includes information about the passengers on the Titanic. The data is split into training and test sets:
- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with features and the target variable (`Survived`).
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data with features but no target variable.

### Data Fields
- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger.
- `Survived`: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- `Name`: Name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: Sex of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Passenger fare.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
- `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is crucial to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables. In this section, we visualize the data and extract insights that guide feature engineering and model selection.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance. Key steps include:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., family size from SibSp and Parch).

## Modeling
Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated in this project, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are used to optimize model performance.

## Conclusion
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics. The insights gained from this project can be applied to similar classification problems and provide a foundation for further exploration in machine learning.
